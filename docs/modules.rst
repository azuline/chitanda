Modules
#######

Note: All module-specific configuration sections should be added to the
top-level dictionary of the JSON, on the same level as ``trigger_character``.

Aliases (\ ``aliases``\ )
-------------------------

This module allows users to trigger a PM containing the list of aliases
specified in the bot's configuration.

Commands:

.. parsed-literal::

   aliases  // sends the list of aliases to the user via PM

Choose (\ ``choose``\ )
-----------------------

The bot can make a choice for you!

Commands:

.. parsed-literal::

   choose <#>-<#>  // bot will respond with a number in the given range
   choose word1 word2 word3  // bot will respond with one of the words
   choose phrase1, phrase2, phrase3  // bot will respond with one of the phrases

GitHub Relay (\ ``github_relay``\ )
-----------------------------------

This module allows the bot to receive GitHub webhooks and report push, issue,
and pull request events to a specified channel. If this module is enabled, a
key/value pair similar to the following should be added to the configuration
file. The webserver should also be enabled. This module creates an endpoint for
GitHub's webhooks at the ``/github`` URL location; thus, the webhook in GitHub
should be configured to target that URL location.


* ``secret`` - A secret key used to verify signed payloads from GitHub.
* ``relay`` - A dictionary mapping repository IDs to lists of channels to relay
  webhook events to.
* ``relay[][[listener]]`` - The identifier of the listener that the destinaton
  channel belongs to. See the Configuration section for identifier formatting.
* ``relay[][[channel]]`` - The channel to relay to. ``#channel`` for IRC and the
  channel ID for Discord.
* ``relay[][[branches]]`` - If empty, commits to all branches will be reported.
  Otherwise, only commits to the listed branches will be reported.

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "github_relay": {
       "secret": null,
       "relay": {
         "1": [
           {
             "listener": "DiscordListener",
             "channel": "12345",
             "branches": [
               "master"
             ]
           }
         ]
       }

   quote find <string>  // searches for a quote from its contents

Relay (\ ``relay``\ )
---------------------

Relays messages between two channels. Handles differences in formatting
between listeners.

The configuration is a list of sublists. The sublists contain dictionaries
detailling the linked channels. Each group of linked channels are their
own sublist. More than two channels can be linked at once.

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "relay": [
       [
